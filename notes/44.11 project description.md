### 1. **Introduction**
The goal of this project is to build a user-friendly and powerful **dynamic form builder**. This application will allow users to design complex forms for various purposes(mostly loan origination).

**Real example** - 
1 - [Optimajet form builder](https://formbuilder.formengine.io/)


---
### 2. **Core Functionality**

The application must provide the following core features:
- **Drag-and-Drop Interface:** Users should be able to intuitively build forms by dragging form elements (e.g., text fields, checkboxes, dropdowns) onto a canvas.
- **Form Element Library:** A library of standard form input types will be available, including:
    - **Text Inputs:** Single-line text, multi-line text (textarea), password.
    - **Select Inputs:** Dropdowns, radio buttons, checkboxes.
    - **Date & Time Pickers:** Date input, time input.
    - **File Upload:** For user file submissions.
    - **Structural Elements:** Sections, headers, dividers.
- **Dynamic Properties:** Each form element should have configurable properties, such as:
    - **Label:** The display text for the input.
    - **Placeholder:** Hint text inside the input field.
    - **Default Value:** The initial value of the input.
    - **Validation Rules:** Required field, minimum/maximum length, regular expression patterns.
- **Form Creation and Storage:**
    - Users must be able to save their created forms.
    - Forms should be stored in a structured format (e.g., JSON) in a database.
        
- **JSON Export:** The application must provide a function to export the form's configuration as a JSON file. This is crucial for external systems to consume and render the form.
- **Form Blocks:** Users can create and save reusable groups of form elements as **form blocks**. These blocks can then be used to quickly assemble new forms. This promotes efficiency and consistency.
- **Multi-Step Forms:** The system will support the creation of multi-step forms or different flows by allowing users to group form elements into distinct "pages" or "steps." This is essential for long or complex questionnaires.

==Iâ€™ll split the features later.==

### 3. **User Interface (UI) & User Experience (UX)**

The UI should be clean, responsive, and easy to navigate.
- **Main Workspace:** The central area where the user drags and drops form elements.
- **Sidebar/Toolbar:** A panel containing the library of available form elements and saved form blocks.
- **Properties Panel:** A dynamic panel that appears when a form element is selected, allowing the user to configure its properties.
- **Responsive Design:** The interface should be usable on various devices, though the primary focus is on desktop use for design purposes.

### 4. **Example Scenarios and JSON Samples**

Here are some examples of forms that can be created with the application and their corresponding JSON representations.

#### **Example 1: Simple Contact Form**

This form will collect basic user information like name, email, and a message.
- **User sees:**
    - **Your Name:** [Text Input]
    - **Your Email:** [Text Input]
    - **Message:** [Textarea]
        
- **JSON Representation:**
```json
    {
      "name": "Contact Form",
      "description": "A simple form for collecting user contact information.",
      "fields": [
        {
          "type": "text",
          "label": "Your Name",
          "name": "your_name",
          "required": true,
          "placeholder": "e.g., Jane Doe"
        },
        {
          "type": "email",
          "label": "Your Email",
          "name": "your_email",
          "required": true,
          "placeholder": "e.g., jane.doe@example.com"
        },
        {
          "type": "textarea",
          "label": "Message",
          "name": "message",
          "required": false
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
    

#### **Example 2: Multi-Step Job Application Form**

This form is divided into three steps: **Personal Information**, **Work Experience**, and **References**.

- **User sees:**
    - **Step 1: Personal Information**
        - Full Name: [Text Input]
        - Phone Number: [Text Input]
    - **Step 2: Work Experience**
        - Previous Employer: [Text Input]
        - Years of Experience: [Number Input]
    - **Step 3: References**
        - Reference 1 Name: [Text Input]
        - Reference 1 Email: [Text Input]
            
- **JSON Representation:**
```json
    {
      "name": "Job Application",
      "description": "A multi-step form for job applications.",
      "steps": [
        {
          "step_name": "Personal Information",
          "fields": [
            {
              "type": "text",
              "label": "Full Name",
              "name": "full_name",
              "required": true
            },
            {
              "type": "tel",
              "label": "Phone Number",
              "name": "phone_number"
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          "step_name": "Work Experience",
          "fields": [
            {
              "type": "text",
              "label": "Previous Employer",
              "name": "previous_employer"
            },
            {
              "type": "number",
              "label": "Years of Experience",
              "name": "years_of_experience",
              "min": 0
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          "step_name": "References",
          "fields": [
            {
              "type": "text",
              "label": "Reference 1 Name",
              "name": "ref1_name"
            },
            {
              "type": "email",
              "label": "Reference 1 Email",
              "name": "ref1_email"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

### 5. **Technical Requirements**
- **Frontend:** A modern JavaScript framework (e.g., **React**, Vue, Angular) for a responsive and dynamic UI.
- **Backend:** A robust backend to handle user authentication, form storage, and JSON export logic (e.g., Node.js with Express, Python with Django/Flask).
- **Database:** A database to store form configurations and user data (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB). **A NoSQL database like MongoDB is a good fit for the flexible JSON structure of the forms.**
